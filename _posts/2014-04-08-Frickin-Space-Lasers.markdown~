Speaking of spacecraft with lasers. I just had an interesting discussion with a [coworker](http://www.pnj.com/article/20140331/NEWS01/303310016/IHMC-finds-its-mother-of-invention-with-Startup-Weekend). We both agreed on the following:

1. [Railguns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun) are [cool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y54aLcC3G74), but the technical challenges surrounding things like [the barrel lining](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a411065.pdf) will take a [few years of deployed use](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/07/us-usa-navy-railgun-idUSBREA361QF20140407) to see completly solved.
2. [Coilguns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coilgun) are cool too, but also frightening. Too much magnet required for a mobile platform. Maybe impossibly much. We theorized on some cool ways to encapsulate the impulse energy requirements in the projectile itself, but that [has been done to death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver#On_Earth).
3. [Chemical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_laser) [pumped lasers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_pumping) are really scary. [Those chemicals?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fluoride) (Or stuff in that catagory) [On a plane?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_YAL-1) Seriously? [No thanks.](http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/things_i_wont_work_with/) 
4. [Nuclear pumped gamma ray lasers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Excalibur) are the coolest, but don't forget about the [backscatter](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/spacegunconvent.php).

Start up fever. That's what I call the current state of the technology union. Startup weekend, Startup bus, startup flight, startup hot tub. There are a new crop of startups are out there, built solely to do one thing. Make money off of startups. Pretty meta huh? No thank you says I.

This is the main indicator I use to detect bubbles. When every weekend there is another workshop, news article, blog post, (Ha!) or other mainstream-bit-of-what-have-you extolling how **simple** and **easy** it is to make money with the current hot idea, it's a bubble. Pure and simple. 

If there is an entire industry around making money off of showing people how to make money in the industry, then the former is dead, and the latter is on its way out.

Take realestate back in 2006-07. There were books, movies, constant news articles; you name it. Bam. 2008 happened,  and we all look back and act like we saw it coming. Same goes for the crazy online marketing craze in 2004. Insanity.

Hell, even the rail-road boom of the 1890's falls into this catagory. Huh, I wonder if there is historical data to back this up? Might be a good chance for me to try out the awesome [data visualzation libary d3js](http://d3js.org/). Yeah, sounds like a cool afternoon project.

TLDR: If you see ads for it on facebook. Don't do it, it won't work out in the end. The people selling the ads to you are making more off of the idea than you ever will. Go do somthing cool. Like spacecraft. With lasers.
